# AI Integration Agency Demo

This repository contains a minimal FastAPI application for scheduling appointments. The design aims for a sleek, high-tech feel inspired by IBM and Apple.

## Features
- Book appointments through a simple web form
- View upcoming appointments
- Backend implemented with FastAPI and SQLite

## Running Locally

Ensure Python 3.11+ is available. Install dependencies and start the server:

```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
